	# In this example we demonstrate setting up encryption parameters and other
	# relevant objects for performing simple computations on encrypted integers.

	# SEAL uses the Fan-Vercauteren (FV) homomorphic encryption scheme. We refer to
	# https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/144 for full details on how the FV scheme works.
	# For better performance, SEAL implements the "FullRNS" optimization of FV, as
	# described in https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/510.

	# The first task is to set up an instance of the EncryptionParameters class.
	# It is critical to understand how these different parameters behave, how they
	# affect the encryption scheme, performance, and the security level. There are
	# three encryption parameters that are necessary to set:

	#     - poly_modulus (polynomial modulus);
	#     - coeff_modulus ([ciphertext] coefficient modulus);
	#     - plain_modulus (plaintext modulus).

	# A fourth parameter -- noise_standard_deviation -- has a default value of 3.19
	# and should not be necessary to modify unless the user has a specific reason
	# to and knows what they are doing.

	# The encryption scheme implemented in SEAL cannot perform arbitrary computations
	# on encrypted data. Instead, each ciphertext has a specific quantity called the
	# `invariant noise budget' -- or `noise budget' for short -- measured in bits.
	# The noise budget of a freshly encrypted ciphertext (initial noise budget) is
	# determined by the encryption parameters. Homomorphic operations consume the
	# noise budget at a rate also determined by the encryption parameters. In SEAL
	# the two basic homomorphic operations are additions and multiplications, of
	# which additions can generally be thought of as being nearly free in terms of
	# noise budget consumption compared to multiplications. Since noise budget
	# consumption is compounding in sequential multiplications, the most significant
	# factor in choosing appropriate encryption parameters is the multiplicative
	# depth of the arithmetic circuit that needs to be evaluated. Once the noise
	# budget in a ciphertext reaches zero, it becomes too corrupted to be decrypted.
	# Thus, it is essential to choose the parameters to be large enough to support
	# the desired computation; otherwise the result is impossible to make sense of
	# even with the secret key.
	parms = EncryptionParameters()

	# We first set the polynomial modulus. This must be a power-of-2 cyclotomic
	# polynomial, i.e. a polynomial of the form "1x^(power-of-2) + 1". The polynomial
	# modulus should be thought of mainly affecting the security level of the scheme;
	# larger polynomial modulus makes the scheme more secure. At the same time, it
	# makes ciphertext sizes larger, and consequently all operations slower.
	# Recommended degrees for poly_modulus are 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768,
	# but it is also possible to go beyond this. Since we perform only a very small
	# computation in this example, it suffices to use a very small polynomial modulus
	parms.set_poly_modulus("1x^2048 + 1")

	# Next we choose the [ciphertext] coefficient modulus (coeff_modulus). The size
	# of the coefficient modulus should be thought of as the most significant factor
	# in determining the noise budget in a freshly encrypted ciphertext: bigger means
	# more noise budget. Unfortunately, a larger coefficient modulus also lowers the
	# security level of the scheme. Thus, if a large noise budget is required for
	# complicated computations, a large coefficient modulus needs to be used, and the
	# reduction in the security level must be countered by simultaneously increasing
	# the polynomial modulus.

	# To make parameter selection easier for the user, we have constructed sets of
	# largest allowed coefficient moduli for 128-bit and 192-bit security levels
	# for different choices of the polynomial modulus. These recommended parameters
	# follow the Security white paper at http://HomomorphicEncryption.org. However,
	# due to the complexity of this topic, we highly recommend the user to directly
	# consult an expert in homomorphic encryption and RLWE-based encryption schemes
	# to determine the security of their parameter choices.

	# Our recommended values for the coefficient modulus can be easily accessed
	# through the functions

	#     coeff_modulus_128bit(int)
	#     coeff_modulus_192bit(int)

	# for 128-bit and 192-bit security levels. The integer parameter is the degree
	# of the polynomial modulus.

	# In SEAL the coefficient modulus is a positive composite number -- a product
	# of distinct primes of size up to 60 bits. When we talk about the size of the
	# coefficient modulus we mean the bit length of the product of the small primes.
	# The small primes are represented by instances of the SmallModulus class; for
	# example coeff_modulus_128bit(int) returns a vector of SmallModulus instances.

	# It is possible for the user to select their own small primes. Since SEAL uses
	# the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) for polynomial multiplications modulo the
	# factors of the coefficient modulus, the factors need to be prime numbers
	# congruent to 1 modulo 2*degree(poly_modulus). We have generated a list of such
	# prime numbers of various sizes, that the user can easily access through the
	# functions

	#     small_mods_60bit(int)
	#     small_mods_50bit(int)
	#     small_mods_40bit(int)
	#     small_mods_30bit(int)

	# each of which gives access to an array of primes of the denoted size. These
	# primes are located in the source file util/globals.cpp.

	# Performance is mainly affected by the size of the polynomial modulus, and the
	# number of prime factors in the coefficient modulus. Thus, it is important to
	# use as few factors in the coefficient modulus as possible.

	# In this example we use the default coefficient modulus for a 128-bit security
	# level. Concretely, this coefficient modulus consists of only one 56-bit prime
	# factor: 0xfffffffff00001.
	parms.set_coeff_modulus(seal.coeff_modulus_128(2048))

	# The plaintext modulus can be any positive integer, even though here we take
	# it to be a power of two. In fact, in many cases one might instead want it to
	# be a prime number; we will see this in example_batching(). The plaintext
	# modulus determines the size of the plaintext data type, but it also affects
	# the noise budget in a freshly encrypted ciphertext, and the consumption of
	# the noise budget in homomorphic multiplication. Thus, it is essential to try
	# to keep the plaintext data type as small as possible for good performance.
	# The noise budget in a freshly encrypted ciphertext is

	#     ~ log2(coeff_modulus/plain_modulus) (bits)

	# and the noise budget consumption in a homomorphic multiplication is of the
	# form log2(plain_modulus) + (other terms).
	parms.set_plain_modulus(1 << 8)

	# Now that all parameters are set, we are ready to construct a SEALContext
	# object. This is a heavy class that checks the validity and properties of
	# the parameters we just set, and performs and stores several important
	# pre-computations.
	context = SEALContext(parms)

	# Print the parameters that we have chosen
	print_parameters(context);

	# Plaintexts in the FV scheme are polynomials with coefficients integers modulo
	# plain_modulus. To encrypt for example integers instead, one can use an
	# `encoding scheme' to represent the integers as such polynomials. SEAL comes
	# with a few basic encoders:

	# [IntegerEncoder]
	# Given an integer base b, encodes integers as plaintext polynomials as follows.
	# First, a base-b expansion of the integer is computed. This expansion uses
	# a `balanced' set of representatives of integers modulo b as the coefficients.
	# Namely, when b is odd the coefficients are integers between -(b-1)/2 and
	# (b-1)/2. When b is even, the integers are between -b/2 and (b-1)/2, except
	# when b is two and the usual binary expansion is used (coefficients 0 and 1).
	# Decoding amounts to evaluating the polynomial at x=b. For example, if b=2,
	# the integer

	#     26 = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1

	# is encoded as the polynomial 1x^4 + 1x^3 + 1x^1. When b=3,

	#     26 = 3^3 - 3^0

	# is encoded as the polynomial 1x^3 - 1. In memory polynomial coefficients are
	# always stored as unsigned integers by storing their smallest non-negative
	# representatives modulo plain_modulus. To create a base-b integer encoder,
	# use the constructor IntegerEncoder(plain_modulus, b). If no b is given, b=2
	# is used.

	# [FractionalEncoder]
	# The FractionalEncoder encodes fixed-precision rational numbers as follows.
	# It expands the number in a given base b, possibly truncating an infinite
	# fractional part to finite precision, e.g.

	#     26.75 = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^(-1) + 2^(-2)

	# when b=2. For the sake of the example, suppose poly_modulus is 1x^1024 + 1.
	# It then represents the integer part of the number in the same way as in
	# IntegerEncoder (with b=2 here), and moves the fractional part instead to the
	# highest degree part of the polynomial, but with signs of the coefficients
	# changed. In this example we would represent 26.75 as the polynomial

	#     -1x^1023 - 1x^1022 + 1x^4 + 1x^3 + 1x^1.

	# In memory the negative coefficients of the polynomial will be represented as
	# their negatives modulo plain_modulus.

	# [PolyCRTBuilder]
	# If plain_modulus is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 2*degree(poly_modulus), the
	# plaintext elements can be viewed as 2-by-(degree(poly_modulus) / 2) matrices
	# with elements integers modulo plain_modulus. When a desired computation can be
	# vectorized, using PolyCRTBuilder can result in massive performance improvements
	# over naively encrypting and operating on each input number separately. Thus,
	# in more complicated computations this is likely to be by far the most important
	# and useful encoder. In example_batching() we show how to use and operate on
	# encrypted matrix plaintexts.

	# For performance reasons, in homomorphic encryption one typically wants to keep
	# the plaintext data types as small as possible, which can make it challenging to
	# prevent data type overflow in more complicated computations, especially when
	# operating on rational numbers that have been scaled to integers. When using
	# PolyCRTBuilder estimating whether an overflow occurs is a fairly standard task,
	# as the matrix slots are integers modulo plain_modulus, and each slot is operated
	# on independently of the others. When using IntegerEncoder or FractionalEncoder
	# it is substantially more difficult to estimate when an overflow occurs in the
	# plaintext, and choosing the plaintext modulus very carefully to be large enough
	# is critical to avoid unexpected results. Specifically, one needs to estimate how
	# large the largest coefficient in  the polynomial view of all of the plaintext
	# elements becomes, and choose the plaintext modulus to be larger than this value.
	# SEAL comes with an automatic parameter selection tool that can help with this
	# task, as is demonstrated in example_parameter_selection().

	# Here we choose to create an IntegerEncoder with base b=2.
	encoder = IntegerEncoder(context.plain_modulus())

	# We are now ready to generate the secret and public keys. For this purpose we need
	# an instance of the KeyGenerator class. Constructing a KeyGenerator automatically
	# generates the public and secret key, which can then be read to local variables.
	# To create a fresh pair of keys one can call KeyGenerator::generate() at any time.
	keygen = KeyGenerator(context)
	public_key = keygen.public_key()

	# To be able to encrypt, we need to construct an instance of Encryptor. Note that

	encryptor = Encryptor(context, public_key)

	# Computations on the ciphertexts are performed with the Evaluator class.
	evaluator = Evaluator(context)

	# We will of course want to decrypt our results to verify that everything worked,
	# so we need to also construct an instance of Decryptor. Note that the Decryptor
	# requires the secret key.
	decryptor = Decryptor(context, secret_key)

	print("Noise budget in encrypted2: " + (str)(decryptor.invariant_noise_budget(encrypted2)) + " bits")

	# As a simple example, we compute (-encrypted1 + encrypted2) * encrypted2.

	# can be used. The in-place variants are always more efficient. Here we overwrite
	# encrypted1 with the sum.
	evaluator.add(encrypted1, encrypted2)

	# It is instructive to think that addition sets the noise budget to the minimum
	# of the input noise budgets. In this case both inputs had roughly the same
	# budget going on, and the output (in encrypted1) has just slightly lower budget.
	# Depending on probabilistic effects, the noise growth consumption may or may
	# not be visible when measured in whole bits.
	print("Noise budget in -encrypted1 + encrypted2: " + (str)(decryptor.invariant_noise_budget(encrypted1)) + " bits")

	# The problem here is that homomorphic operations on large ciphertexts are

	# homomorphic multiplication on input ciphertexts of size M and N will require
	# O(M*N) polynomial multiplications to be performed, and an addition will
	# require O(M+N) additions. Relinearization reduces the size of the ciphertexts
	# after multiplication back to the initial size (2). Thus, relinearizing one
	# or both inputs before the next multiplication, or e.g. before serializing the
	# ciphertexts, can have a huge positive impact on performance.

	# Another problem is that the noise budget consumption in multiplication is
	# bigger when the input ciphertexts sizes are bigger. In a complicated
	# computation the contribution of the sizes to the noise budget consumption
	# can actually become the dominant term. We will point this out again below
	# once we get to our example.

	# Relinearization itself has both a computational cost and a noise budget cost.
	# These both depend on a parameter called `decomposition bit count', which can
	# be any integer at least 1 [dbc_min()] and at most 60 [dbc_max()]. A large
	# decomposition bit count makes relinearization fast, but consumes more noise
	# budget. A small decomposition bit count can make relinearization slower, but
	# might not change the noise budget by any observable amount.

	# Relinearization requires a special type of key called `evaluation keys'.
	# These can be created by the KeyGenerator for any decomposition bit count.
	# To relinearize a ciphertext of size M >= 2 back to size 2, we actually need
	# M-2 evaluation keys. Attempting to relinearize a too large ciphertext with
	# too few evaluation keys will result in an exception being thrown.

	# We repeat our computation, but this time relinearize after both squarings.
	# Since our ciphertext never grows past size 3 (we relinearize after every
	# multiplication), it suffices to generate only one evaluation key.

	# budget from the maximum (freshly encrypted ciphertext) down to a fixed

	# count. On the other hand, homomorphic multiplication always consumes the
	# noise budget from its current level. This is why the second relinearization
