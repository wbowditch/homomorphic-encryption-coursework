This repository is for my eSecurity coursework on homomorphic encryption.

To build the docker image containing the simulated homomorphic exchange from Section 3 of the coursework:

```
sudo ./build-docker.sh
```

To run the docker image:

```
sudo ./run-docker.sh
```

Despite a few modifications, original code mainly resides in benchmark/main.py
